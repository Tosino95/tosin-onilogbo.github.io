Today I Learned is a forum style application that allows users to simply share a fact or view facts created by themselves or others. Users also have three different options in how they want to rate a fact. This app was developed using React and Supabase. Supabase stores the data and provides API calls that React then uses to create or retrieve facts from the database. The static website is hosted on AWS S3.
