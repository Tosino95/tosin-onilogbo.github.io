Forkify allows users to search, create, and bookmark recipes. Users can update number of servings. When creating a new recipe, users can even upload a photo of their favorite recipe. If there are any recipes that a user wants to review later, they can bookmark it. This application was developed using vanilla JavaScript that implements a MVC architecture. To handle events in this application, a publisher-subscriber model is used to do so. LocalStorage is used to store bookmarked recipes that users can review later.
